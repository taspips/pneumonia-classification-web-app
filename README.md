## This repository demonstrates Part 2 of the Mini Project:

- **Serve a Streamlit App based on a NN model**

1. The link of the github repository: https://github.com/taspips/pneumonia-classification-web-app/
2. The link to the streamlit app: https://pneumonia-classificationgrp2.streamlit.app/

### This application is a **Chest X-Ray Image Classifier** that takes the pictures and returns **Normal** for humans without pneumonia and **Pneumonia** for those that are with pneumonia. 

The dataset was taken in the link: [Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images for Classification](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2).

We are using an existing Streamlit App that is using a Neural Network. 

## Some of the changes that we are doing to this app are:

1. Changing the background image that it is an AI generated image from Dreamstudio. 

2. Creating a .gitignore file and update it as per our requirements.

3. Updating the h5 file.

4. Updating the README file.

## We are providing some screenshots to see that the application is working: 

#### This is an X-Ray image of a person with pneumonia:

#### After we added to our app, the accuracy was 99.5% that is detected with pneumonia.

#### This is an X-Ray image of a person without pneumonia:

#### After we added to our app, the accuracy was 89.5% that is without pneumonia, so normal person.
